Written by `plugins/session-memory/hooks/pre-compact/save-session.sh` (V4 Session Continuity Graph).  
Path: `plugins/session-memory/state/session-graph.json`

## Top-level object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ts` | string (ISO 8601) | UTC timestamp when the graph was saved |
| `session` | string | MD5 hash of the transcript path; identifies the session |
| `total_changes` | integer | Number of change entries in `change-tracker/state/changes.jsonl` at save time |
| `trust` | object | Summary counts across trust bands (see below) |
| `reviews` | integer | Number of `review_advisory` events emitted by decision-gate this session |
| `nodes` | array | File nodes (up to 50); one per distinct file changed (see below) |
| `edges` | array | Cluster edges (up to 20); groups of files changed together (see below) |

---

## `trust` object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `high` | integer | Count of files with trust score ≥ `CROW_TRUST_HIGH` (default 0.8) |
| `low` | integer | Count of files with trust score < `CROW_TRUST_LOW` (default 0.4) |
| `critical` | integer | Count of files with trust score < `CROW_TRUST_CRITICAL` (default 0.2) |

---

## `nodes` array items

Each node represents a distinct file that was changed during the session.  
Built from `change-tracker/state/changes.jsonl`, grouped by `file`, sorted descending by `change_count`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | string | Absolute or relative file path |
| `type` | string | Change type of the first recorded change (e.g. `source_code`, `config_change`, `test_change`, `schema_change`, `dependency_change`, `documentation`) |
| `change_count` | integer | Number of times this file was changed this session |
| `last_hash` | string | Hash of the last change entry for this file |
| `cluster_id` | string | Cluster identifier from the last recorded change (empty string if unclustered) |

---

## `edges` array items

Each edge represents a set of files changed together under the same cluster.  
Only clusters with 2 or more distinct files are included.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cluster` | string | Cluster identifier shared by all files in this edge |
| `files` | array of strings | Unique file paths that share this cluster |

## Notes

- The graph is written atomically via a temp file + `mv` under a file lock.
- At most 50 nodes and 20 edges are stored; the highest-frequency files and clusters are retained.
- The `session` hash is derived from the transcript file path; it is stable within one Claude Code session but changes on session restart.
- The companion `session-summary.md` in the same directory provides a human-readable version of the same data for the restorer agent.
