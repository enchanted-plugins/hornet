"""Vigil V1 deep: Semantic diff analysis with hunk classification and complexity scoring.

Analyzes unified diffs to classify changes at the hunk level.
Called by track-change.sh when Python is available and change is large.
Stdlib only — no external dependencies.

Usage: python3 diff-analyzer.py <file_before> <file_after>
Output: JSON to stdout
